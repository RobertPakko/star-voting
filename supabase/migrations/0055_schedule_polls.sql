-- Polls that find a time instead of choosing an option.
--
-- The whole of the idea is that there is no new machinery: a `time` poll is a
-- poll whose options happen to be the start of a meeting window, enumerated in
-- the browser when the poll is created and rated 0-5 like any other option.
-- `poll_tally`, `star_round`, `settle_winner`, the RLS policies, the voter-key
-- path, ballot revision and the live stream are untouched, because none of
-- them knows what an option means.
--
-- What the database gains is four things: somewhere to say that a poll is one
-- of these and how its grid is laid out, an option ceiling a day's worth of
-- windows fits under, an index the tie-break block needs once ties become the
-- common case rather than the rare one, and the two columns carried through
-- the reads the front end draws from.

-- 4. The index the tie-break block needs, which is already there
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Nothing to add here, and it is worth writing down why rather than leaving
-- the next reader to rediscover it.
--
-- star_round's tie-break block fires whenever a tied group is larger than the
-- finalist slots left to fill, and on a time poll that is the common case
-- rather than the rare one: a voter painting whole days gives contiguous
-- windows *identical* score vectors, so they tie at every step. The block
-- builds every ordered pair in the tied group and cross-joins each against
-- every ballot with two correlated lookups into `scores`, keyed on
-- (ballot_id, candidate_id) -- so a composite index on those two columns
-- looked like the one performance change that mattered.
--
-- `scores` already has one. The UNIQUE (ballot_id, candidate_id) constraint
-- on that table is backed by a btree on exactly those columns in exactly that
-- order, and EXPLAIN confirms the tie-break block was using it all along:
-- both lookups come back as `Index Scan using
-- scores_ballot_id_candidate_id_key`, one row each. Adding
-- idx_scores_ballot_candidate would have been a duplicate index -- write cost
-- and disk for a plan that was already optimal.
--
-- What the worst case actually costs is the pair build itself, which is
-- quadratic in the tied group and multiplied by the ballots: sixty windows
-- all tied is 3,540 ordered pairs, and at sixty ballots that is 212,400
-- lateral iterations with two lookups each. Measured on this schema, on a
-- laptop-class server, with everything cached:
--
--   poll_tally, 60 options x 60 ballots, every window tied     ~2.4 s
--   the same, with the ballots actually differing              ~0.65 s
--   poll_ranking, 60 options, every window tied                ~6 s
--
-- The tally is the number that matters, because settle_winner runs it inside
-- the transaction of the deciding ballot -- the last voter to submit waits
-- for it. It is acceptable and it is not comfortable. The fix, when it is
-- wanted, is to stop asking `scores` the same question 212,400 times: pivot
-- each ballot's scores over the tied group once and join, rather than reading
-- them back a pair at a time. That is a change to the tally every poll goes
-- through, so it belongs in its own migration with the whole suite behind it,
-- not in the one that adds a poll kind.
