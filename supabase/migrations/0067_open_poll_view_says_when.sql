-- open_poll_view says when the poll was created.
--
-- The poll list carries the open polls this browser has opened, and watches
-- the ones on the page in front of the reader on their own topics. It has to
-- be subscribed to them before the read that draws the page -- a topic joined
-- after a read leaves a gap in which a vote goes unannounced -- and it cannot
-- ask the page what is on it without reading it. It can work it out, though:
-- the list is ordered newest first, so the opened polls on page one are among
-- the ten newest opened polls, and those on a later page among the ten newest
-- older than the page before it ended. That needs each poll's creation date,
-- and the page that opens a poll through its link is the one place the browser
-- could have learned it. So the view carries it.
--
-- Nothing new is disclosed that matters: the date a poll was made is a fact
-- about a poll whose link the reader already holds, it never changes, and the
-- retention policy it implies is public on the About page. The page itself
-- still draws no expiry date; see "Polls are deleted after six months".
--
-- Restated whole because the function builds its poll object field by field;
-- only the one line marked below is new. CREATE OR REPLACE keeps the grants.
