-- Undo 0055_schedule_polls.sql.
--
-- Deliberately NOT in supabase/migrations/: everything in that directory is
-- applied, in order, by the Supabase GitHub integration. This is a file you
-- run by hand, at a psql prompt, when 0055 is already committed on a database
-- and you want it gone.
--
--     psql -d <database> -f supabase/rollback/0055_schedule_polls.down.sql
--
-- **On a database where nothing has been committed yet, you do not need this.**
-- Postgres has transactional DDL, so the whole migration can be tried and
-- thrown away:
--
--     begin;
--     \i supabase/migrations/0055_schedule_polls.sql
--     -- poke at it, run whatever you like
--     rollback;
--
-- That leaves the schema byte-identical -- every function definition, column
-- and constraint -- and is the loop to use while the SQL is still moving.
--
-- What this file does, in the order that matters: drop what 0055 added, then
-- restore the five functions it replaced to their 0053 definitions verbatim.
-- The bodies below are copied from 0053_baseline.sql and are not edited; if
-- 0053 is ever squashed away, regenerate them from whatever the new baseline
-- says rather than trusting this copy.
--
-- **It is not lossless, and cannot be.** Dropping `polls.kind` and
-- `polls.schedule` destroys every time poll's grid. The poll rows and their
-- options survive -- a time poll's options are ordinary rows in `candidates`
-- and its ballots ordinary rows in `scores`, which is the whole design -- so
-- what you are left with is an ordinary poll whose options are ISO timestamps.
-- It still tallies. Nobody can paint a calendar on it again.
